I just gave the final talk of my interdisciplinary research project (IDP). 
You can read the [talk's abstract](http://adrian-haarbach.de/idp-graph-algorithms/reveal.js/abstract.html)  
and browse through the [talk's slides](http://adrian-haarbach.de/idp-graph-algorithms/reveal.js/index.html)
right in your browser, since I used [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) to make them.

The interactive visualizations of the two graph algorithms I choose still require some furbishing and bugfixing, but you can check them out already:  
[Push-relabel algorithm for the max flow problem](http://adrian-haarbach.de/idp-graph-algorithms/maxflow-push-relabel/index_en.html)  
[Label Setting algorithm for the SPPRC problem](http://adrian-haarbach.de/idp-graph-algorithms/spp-rc-label-setting/index_en.html)  

All the code developed is open sourced in the github repository [idp-graph-algorithms](https://github.com/adrelino/idp-graph-algorithms)

The final documentation is still work in progress, but I will upload it here once finished.

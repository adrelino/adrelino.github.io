I just gave the final talk of my [interdisciplinary research project (IDP)](idp-graph-algorithms) about the visualisation of advanced graph algorithms.
You can read the [talk's abstract](idp-graph-algorithms/presentation/abstract.html)  
and browse through the [talk's slides](idp-graph-algorithms/presentation/slides.html)
right in your browser, since I used [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) to make them.

The interactive visualizations of the two graph algorithms I choose are still work in progress and require some furbishing and bugfixing, but you can test them out already:
[Push-relabel algorithm for the max flow problem](idp-graph-algorithms/implementation/maxflow-push-relabel/index_en.html)  
[Label Setting algorithm for the SPPRC problem](idp-graph-algorithms/implementation/spp-rc-label-setting/index_en.html)  

I welcome any feedback!

All the code developed is open sourced in the github repository [idp-graph-algorithms](https://github.com/adrelino/idp-graph-algorithms)

The final documentation is still work in progress, but I will upload it here once finished.

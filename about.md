## Academics
Since 2019, I am a [PhD Student in Computer Science](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/AdrianHaarbach) at Technische Universität München (TUM) and Siemens AG supervised by [Slobodan Ilic](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/SlobodanIlic) and [Matthias Nießner](https://www.niessnerlab.org/members/matthias_niessner/profile.html).
Prior to this, also at TUM, I completed my [master's]({% post_url 2016-12-15-mscthesis %}) degree in late 2016 and my [bachelor's]({% post_url 2015-03-15-bscthesis %}) degree in early 2015.

## Work
From 2017-2019 I was working as a Research Scientist in Computer Vision R&D at Siemens AG in Munich. Prior to this, I have been at NavVis, EyeClick, BMW, Google, BrainLab and TechniData(now SAP). Since 2010, I also work part-time as a freelance web-developer for NetwakeVision in my hometown Überlingen.

## Travel
So far, I lived in France (Alsace), the US (Texas), Hanoi, Singapore, Dublin and Tel Aviv for exchange semesters, language studies or internships.
